# MP Salary Awareness App

    Author: Wycliffe Ndiba

## Description

This is a web application that displays what one MPs salary (basic salary + allowances) can do for the common mwananchi for a month. The application is built using Next.js and Shadcn UI.

> This application is stemmed from my deeply rooted and only recently discovered frustrations from the Kenyan MPs who are always increasing their salaries and allowances while the common mwananchi is struggling to make ends meet. I wanted to create an application that would show the common mwananchi what the MPs salary can do for them.
